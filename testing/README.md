# QEMU based integration testing

> This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.
What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.

Testing other architectures is even more Fun than packaging for them. The scripts here make it plausible, if not exactly great.

## Prerequisites
1. Expect qemu to consume at least 1.2GiB of RAM in the worst case scenario.
2. Run `scripts/install-deps.sh` to install system level dependencies such as qemu. It assumes Debian, so you may need to substitute as necessary.
3. Your normal user is assumed to be able to run qemu & KVM. Usually this means belonging to the `kvm` group.

## Testing procedure

1. `cd` to the root of the `testing/` dir.
1. Download a GHA repo snapshot artifact zip and place it in the current directory as `kanidm_ppa_snapshot.zip`. Or, check the settings
   further down to test in other ways without a snapshot.
1. Run `IDM_URI=https://idm.example.com scripts/run-all.sh`, you may want to override other bits of env, see the bottom of this README.
   - At first your snapshot is unpacked and a mirror is launched with the contents listening on localhost.
   - You can view what's going on in the console of the qemu VM with `nc localhost 4321`, this is only necessary if something goes horribly wrong.
   - You can poke at the qemu console itself with `socat -,echo=0,icanon=0 unix-connect:qemu-monitor.socket` if something is even more wrong.
1. Once the VM is up and reachable, integration starts. Once it's following the kanidm-unixd, kanidm-unixd-tasks & sshd logs you're ready to test.
   If anything goes wrong, execution will pause instead with a warning to allow investigation.
1. Testing time.
   - A good basic test is to run in another terminal:
   ```shell
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
    localhost -p 2222 \
    "uname -a && cat /etc/os-release && kanidm login -D anonymous && kanidm self whoami"
   ```
   - Or if that doesn't work, troubleshoot via the cloud-init injected root key:
   ```shell
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
    -i ssh_ed25519 root@localhost -p 2222
   ```
1. Once  happy with the permutation, hit `^C` in the original terminal to terminate the permutation. Hit `Enter` to continue to the next one.
1. Iterate until your willpower has crumbled or you reach the end of the target list.

### Known issues
- aarch64 is super slow cross-arch, so we disable cross-arch by default. Instead, run the same testing natively on an aarch64 platform and it'll work ok.
- We throw 4 cores for the cpu so that mounting the rootfs is fast enough to not time out on ubuntu. Yes, that's a crazy problem to have.
- If you insist in running aarch64 cross-arch, beware that systemd will throw weird hissyfits. The arguments try to work around it, but it's not foolproof.
- We expand every disk image a bit because some default image sizes only leave ~200MiB of free space which isn't enough for our deb sizes to go through dpkg copy logic.
  This makes GPT unhappy, but that seems to be ok.

### Config tweaks
You can set various environment variables to change testing behavior, either to suit your environment, or to test different things.
For example, `USE_DEBDIR` can be very helpful in rapid testing of packaging & code changes without waiting for a full snapshot
build from GHA, though less valuable for proving the PPA itself will be functional.

#### Testing different things
- `CATEGORY` - Which mirror category to install, `stable` (default) or `nightly`.
- `KANIDM_VERSION` - Version prefix to install from the category. `1.4` would install the latest available 1.4, say 1.4.6. The default is latest.
- `USE_LIVE` - Use the live Kanidm PPA mirror instead of a local snapshot. Default is `false`.
- `USE_DEBDIR` - Instead of a mirror snapshot (the default) or the live mirror, install deb
packages from the dir given with this option.
- `TEST_TARGETS` - Space separated list of distro targets to run. Defaults to running all applicable
  targets. See `lib/targets.sh` for valid targets.
- `ALLOW_UNSIGNED` - Accept an unsigned kanidm_ppa_snapshot.zip. Defaults to `true` but raises
  warnings.

#### Settings for your environment
- `IDM_URI` - Change which live kanidm server is used. Your user is expected to have SSH & posix enabled on this server.
  Set to `local` to spin up kanidmd within the VM and use that. This is not yet supported in all versions.
- `IDM_GROUP` - A posix enabled group on the above server to gate unixd authentication.
- `IDM_USER` - User expected to be able to log in, defaults to `$USER`.
- `SSH_PUBLICKEY` - Only relevant if `IDM_URI=local`. The public key to enable for SSH login.

#### Port settings
All ports are bound only on localhost, so should normally not interfere with other activity.

- `MIRROR_PORT` - 31625 - Port to use for the snapshot mirror httpd.
- `SSH_PORT`    - 2222  - Port for the VM SSHD to listen on.
- `TELNET_PORT` - 4321  - Port for the VM console to listen on.
- `IDM_PORT` - 58915  - Port for the VM internal kanidmd. Only relevant if `IDM_URI=local`.
